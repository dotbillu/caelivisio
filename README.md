Caelivisio (from Latin *'caeli'* for sky and *'visio'* for vision) is a web application that brings the cosmos to your browser. It renders an interactive 3D simulation of Earth's orbit and tracks Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using real-time data from NASA APIs. Explore our cosmic neighborhood and see which asteroids are passing by!
